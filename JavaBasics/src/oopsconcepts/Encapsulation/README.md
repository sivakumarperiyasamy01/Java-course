- Encapsulation means wrapping variables and methods together as a single unit
- Control access using methods (getters/setters).
- Allows you to control how data is accessed or changed
- It means hiding your classâ€™s internal data and only allowing safe, limited access through methods.
  This is a core idea of encapsulation in object-oriented programming

-Use private variables.
-Use public methods to get/set data.

-Prevent direct access = better security and control.
