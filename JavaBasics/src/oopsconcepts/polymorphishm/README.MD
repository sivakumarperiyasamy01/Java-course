
- The same method or object can behave differently based on the situation.

  -Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
    -Same method name, but different parameters.
    -Java decides which method to run during compilation.


Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)- inheritence 
    -A subclass changes the behavior of a method from the parent class.
    -Java decides which method to run during execution.

RealLife Examples
-Let’s say you have a remote control.
When connected to a TV, it changes channels.
When connected to a fan, it changes speed.
When connected to a light, it turns it on or off.
So, one remote → many uses, depending on the device.
That’s what polymorphism is in Java.
